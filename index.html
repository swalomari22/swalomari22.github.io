            <h2>Where Do I See Myself in 4 Years?</h2>
            <p> In fact, I have always aspired to work. I donâ€™t see myself except in a job within my specialty,
			perhaps in Canada or the Arabian Gulf. I have a simple office,
			I work in a simple job, and I have my own salary.
			I like to be a freelancer while I also have a job (yes, I like pressure, it is better than nothing).
			If you asked me what I would be like in 20 years,
			I would tell you that I own a private company.But now I am only looking for development.
			I will not enter a world in which I cannot support myself.
			I will also have four certifications specialized in cyber security, specifically the Red Hat.</p>
